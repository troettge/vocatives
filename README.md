# When the tune shapes morphology - the origins of vocatives

An investigation of whether vocative markers are more tune-friendly than comparable case markers.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
## define package list
packages <- c("readbulk",
              "rstudioapi",
	      "tidyverse",
              "brms",
              "ggbeeswarm",
              "maps")

## install packages (don't run)
install.packages(packages)

```

### Content

#### raw_data
Contains the data table generated when collecting the corpus:
  * `vocatives_glottolog.csv`
  * `vocatives.csv`

TO DO: what's in there and generate code book

#### derived_data
Contains all data derived by `01_merge_glottolog.R` and `vocative_variable.Rmd`
  * `vocatives_processed.csv`
  * `languages_and_dialects_geo.csv`: 
  
  glottocode: 	glottolog code of language 	
  name:		language name
  isocodes:	isocode if available
  level:	categorization as language or dialect
  macroarea:	glottolog macroarea categorization into Africa, Australia, Eurasia, North America, Papunesia, South America
  latitude:	self-explanatory
  longitude:	self-explanatory
  
  
  * `voc_languages.csv`	
  * `glottolog_complete.csv`
  * `glottolog_complete_add_on.csv`
  
TO DO: code book for new variables

#### scripts 
Contains all scripts numbered according to its usage:
* `00_packages.R` installs all relevant packages and snapshots it with packrat
* `00_packratRestore.R` can be executed by the user to restore the libary required for the scripts
* `01_merge_glottolog` merges `Glottolog_complete.csv` and `languages_and_dialects_geo.csv`.
* `0#_vocatives_variables.Rmd` DESCRIBE
* `0#_vocatives-models.Rmd` runs all relevant Bayesian models and stores model outputs in `models`.
* `0#_vocatives_plots.Rmd` takes model outputs and creates plots, stored in `plots`
  
#### plots  
Contains all plots generated by `0#_vocatives_plots.Rmd` in `png` and `pdf`

#### model
Contains all model objects generated in `0#_vocatives-models.Rmd`
